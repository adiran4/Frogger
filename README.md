# Frogger

Frogger is an classic arcade game where the objective is to help the character cross from the one side of the screen to the other without hitting any obstacles in the way. This was the project I chose as my final project for my EE 271 class(Digital Circuit and Systems). This project utilises System Verilog as the programming language implemented on a FPGA(Field Programming Gate Array).
